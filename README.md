Hi there. Welcome to my code repositories. 

I write code mostly for my classes at [ITP/IMA](https://itp.nyu.edu) at New York University, where I teach.  I'm also a co-founder of [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc), and mostly have written example sketches for many of the core functions and libraries. I also have a number of personal repositories of Arduino sketches. There are a few personal projects here too.
